## Always Ask Questions
When you get stuck, Google is your best friend. Pretty much all developers spend 90% of their time googling answers. You aren’t expected to remember every CSS property or what JavaScript method to use. So use Google to your advantage.

Once you have tried your own research, and you still cannot fix your issue, ask another dev for help. If you have other devs in your team, talk to them. If not, try Stack Overflow or Discord communities.
Ask as many questions as you can. Ask for help on issues, ask for help to understand concepts, and ask for feedback on completed work. There is no limit on what to ask, and every question is a valid one. Other developers are there to help, and they have all asked the same questions when they were beginners.

## Build Anything
Side projects are an excellent way to upskill and learn new things. However, they are also time consuming and hard to manage if you already work full-time. Start small and gradually increase the size of your projects as you complete them. You won’t become overwhelmed by trying to learn ten different concepts at once, and you will achieve great satisfaction when you finish a project.

## People are human
Mistakes are common in the workplace and happen to everyone. They are excellent learning opportunities, but also very stressful and often embarrassing. But that is okay.

If something critical happens, instead of panicking and frantically struggling to fix the issue, grab another dev and explain what happened. More often than not, they will be able to identify the issue and help rectify it.

It is not the end of the world if a website goes down for 15 minutes. A good developer will help you put in preventative measures to stop issues happening again, and probably tell you a few horror stories of their own.

## Plan
Setting clear objectives is an excellent way to measure your work pace and plan your day. Planning out your day can also help you track how much time you spend completing a task. This comes in super helpful if you need to quote hours for a job. Big tasks, like launching a website, can benefit from having a checklist of items to complete.
Planning tasks accordingly is also a great way to work in a scrum/agile team. These often require you to break down your larger projects into smaller deliverable parts to keep progressing.

## Getting a job
You will learn more at a job than through any online course. Understanding the basics will help you get your foot in the door. Here are some extra tips to help you in your job search.

### Your resume
Create a clean resume that is easy to scan and read. Avoid using a Microsoft Word document. Instead use canva template and export as a PDF. If you have a public Github profile, add links to your recent work. This will help developers understand what work you’ve previously accomplished. And finally, only list work experience that is relevant to the role you are applying for. 

### Multiple job applications
It’s okay to have multiple job applications going at once. You want to maximise your options. Apply for everything you know you can do, and everything you think you can do. Many companies hire juniors with the expectation that they will grow. You don’t need to know everything at the start, you just need to show your potential employers that you are willing to learn.

### The interview
Prepare some questions so you can get a better understanding about the workplace you might become employed at. Some good options are:
- What kinds of tech stack do we use for our clients?
- Who are our biggest clients?
- What other teams/people might I work with?
-What sort of group activities does the team do together when not working?

It is okay if you do not understand a technology or concept the employer might use. If they use an unpopular stack you can ask where to find the best learning resources for it.

It is quite common for employers to ask you to complete a technical test. This is to help gauge your technical and problem solving abilities. Complete it to the best of your abilities within a realistic timeframe. You will not need to do ten hours of work on the test. When handing it in, provide a brief summary of how hard/easy you found it, what you struggled or did well with, and what you would add if you had more time.

### Don’t assume it’s a no
If you have not heard back in a while, it might be easy to assume your application was declined. Some potential employers might ignore applicants, some might not have finished their recruiting process. Reach out to the point of contact by email or phone and ask if they have an update on the progress of your application. They should be able to give you an answer or a timeframe for when you can expect a response.
