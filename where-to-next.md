## WordPress and PHP
WordPress is an excellent tool to naturally move into after learning the basics of web development. Over 40% of all websites that exist today run on WordPress, and its easy-to-use admin panel and block editor are great for new developers. You can easily create custom themes and functionality, but the real power comes from having access to database controlled content, and a large community that has created plugins for just about everything. Remember to always keep your WordPress site and plugins up to date, take regular backups, and use recommended security plugins to protect your site.

Here are some WordPress related links you should check out:
- WordPress.org - Download and read documentation
- Understrap - Developer friendly theme that uses Bootstrap v5
- WordFence - Security and Monitoring plugin

## ReactJS and other Popular Frameworks
If you are looking into developing web applications, ReactJS is a good option and is the most popular JavaScript framework at the moment. There are endless amounts of tutorials and guides to find online. Check out the new documentation [https://beta.reactjs.org/] for some beginner examples. It is a steep learning curve, especially if you are new to JavaScript. But the payoff is worth the effort. React developers are in high demand and there are plenty of career opportunities out there.


## Static Site Generators
Static Site Generators (SSG) supercharge the basics of web development. These generators allow you to create pages, templates, and collections, which all get compiled and compressed to HTML files. This means they are often super fast to load, and can be as simple or complex as you like. SSGs are excellent for personal websites, small blogs, and basic informational websites.

## Webflow and No-Code platforms
If you aren’t sold on writing code, there are many no-code platforms that let you create websites. Webflow lets you create highly customised websites all with a point and click interface. Shopify lets you create and manage online stores. These platforms also offer a wide range of community created themes and plugins to extend the functionality of your website. They also host the website themselves, so you won’t need to worry about that.
